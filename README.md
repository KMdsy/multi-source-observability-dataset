# Multi-source Dataset of IT Observability Data forAIOps Research
This repository contains all the implementation details, code, and the multi-source distributed system dataset.

You may find details of this dataset from the original paper: 

*Sasho Nedelkoski et al., "A Multi-source Dataset of IT Observability Data for AIOps Research".*

<b>If you use the data, implementation, or any details of the paper, please cite!</b>

The multi-source/multimodal dataset is composed of distributed traces, application logs, and metrics produced from running a complex distributed system (Openstack). We provide two datasets, which differ on how the workload is executed. The <b>*multimodal sequential-workload data*</b> is generated via executing workload of sequential user requests. The <b>*multimodal concurrent-workload data*</b> is generated via executing workload of concurrent user requests. 

If you are interested in these data, please request the data via <a href="url">Zenodo</a>. Kindly note that the affiliation, and information about the utilization of the dataset. If you do not receive any response from Zenodo within one week, please check your spam mailbox or consider to resubmit your data request with the required information.
